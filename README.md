# Evil Hangman
Ever wonder how Hangman is pretty easy to beat? Let's make an AI for Hangman that tries to beat the player by cheating! The AI will cheat during the game by commiting to a set of words instead of a single word. Thus, the AI will gather information based on the character input and calculates steps ahead to beat its opponent, pretty clever and evil! This coding project is an implementation of the Evil Hangman assignment with additional Java Swing GUI. More details about the homework assignment and the Evil Hangman AI can be found with the link: http://nifty.stanford.edu/2011/schwarz-evil-hangman/

* Java Swing \(Java's GUI Library\)
* Java I/O
* Java Collections Library
* JUnit 4 \(for testing\)
* Image & Audio files \(linked in [Credits](#credits) section\)

## Features
This project has the following features:
* Save game progress
* Load pervious game progress
* Resetting game

## Getting Started

## Instructions
To play the game, download the project folder and run the "Game.java" class. Once the game is loaded please press the "Help" button to read the instructions or read the instructions itself in the "HelpMenu.java" class. During the game, there will be audio sounds that are played, which are memes! Yes, there will be memes played during the game. If you don't want to hear the memes, please turn off your volume or comment the code section off in the paintComponent function of the "GameCourt.java" class. More information to play the game can be found in the "HelpMenu.java" class.
